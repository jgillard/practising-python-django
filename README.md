# Practising Python Django

# About

A continuation of the project started in https://github.com/jgillard/practising-go-tdd.

I intend to cover Django with a Postgres backend, Django Rest Framework, and maybe GraphQL.

This has been developed with Python 3.7.2, and is currently using Django 2.1.5.

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Deployment

Currently deployed on every push to master by Heroku.
